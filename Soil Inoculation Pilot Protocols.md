Soil Inoculation Pilot

## Study Plans and Protocols

**In the field \- August 11-15**

* At each of the 10 sites at MORA:  
  * Record approximate forest composition, including dominant species in canopy and canopy cover  
  * Take soil samples from adjacent to seed traps at locations both near and far from adult conspecific tree according to the protocol below  
* For each soil sample collected:  
  * Using a soil corer if available (or a spade if not), dig out a soil sample from a depth of 5 cm with a diameter of 2.5cm (or up to 15 cm according to Coughlin) retaining litter as well as lower soil levels  
  * Soil corer or spade will be sterilized between each soil collection, how should we do this?  
  * Should we also wear new gloves at each soil collection?  
  * Record soil type as well as horizon composition (O vs A)?  
  * Store soil sample in a plastic zip lock bag with a label noting its site and either near or far from conspecific   
  * When we arrive at cooler, store all plastic bags in the cooler near 4 C (but do not freeze)   
  * Immediately upon returning from the field, store soil samples in cold room provided in forestry (Nolan was trained on this)

Things to bring:

- Notebook (and pencil/pen)  
- Soil corer  
- 20 (minimium) plastic ziploc bags, pre-labeled if possible  
- Cooler for just soil  
- Data sheet if there is sufficient data to collect (soil layers, tree cover, …)

**Lab protocol: experiment set-up \- August 16-23 (10-20 hours)**

* Sterilize seeds with a laundry bleach solution containing 2 parts bleach to 3 parts water (Wenny and Dumroese 1987\)  
  * Soak in bleach solution for 10 minutes with constant agitation  
    * Discard bleach solution after a single use  
  * Soak in water with constant agitation for 5 minutes to rinse off bleach to prevent damage to seeds  
  * Wenny 1987 suggests rinsing in running tap water for 2 days continuous to ensure all bleach is removed (may not be necessary)  
* Use autoclave to sterilize both field soil and matrix potting soil   
  * 25L bags of soil available at canadian tire for only a few $$, which would we need?   
    * Could also get in touch with Dan at the field to see what he suggests  
  * Autoclave time slot will need to be booked (Nolan can take care of this, will decide on dates and times soon)  
  * It should be possible to autoclave most of the soil in one go (2 hours maximum), but two timeslots should be booked in case agar plates show microbial growth  
  * After autoclaving, perform microbial assays using agar plates (repetition required still needs to be decided)  
    * Contact Jenny Escano [mjescano@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:mjescano@mail.ubc.ca) for agar at $21.05 per litre (may be cheaper options available, didn’t see any on UBC stores)  
* Using autoclaved soil and sterilized seeds, set up each of the 80 treatments in separate plant pots  
  * Literature review suggests 1L pots is a good volume to use for each treatment  
  * 5-10 seeds per pot  
  * Fill pot half way with sterilized matrix soil, then add inoculum as a (or autoclaved field soil), then cover with more sterile matrix soil   
  * Germinate seeds according to ideal stratification conditions  
  * Change gloves between handling any non-sterile material to avoid spread of pathogens between samples

Things we need:

- Plant pots (might have enough already)  
- Seeds  
- Agar and agar plates  
- Soil  
- Bleach solution  
- Gloves (if we don’t have in lab)

**Lab protocol: germination monitoring and data collection \- August 23 onwards (10 hours per week)**

* Plant pots that we plan to use are 10 by 10 cm, and the available growth chambers are 75 by 240 cm (assuming I measured the right one)   
  * This gives us space for approximately 160 of these plant pots at maximum fill  
  * Sufficient for the entire experiment, including flexibility for gaps between treatments and extra plant pots for controls or germination success tests  
*
